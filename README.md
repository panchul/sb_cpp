## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

# sb_cpp

C/C++ sandbox for variety of templates, tutorial snippets, etc.

This repository could be a useful starting point for writing code, or demoing how to write code.
It could be used on its own, or deployed on a virtual machine within the workspace [https://github.com/panchul/workspace](https://github.com/panchul/workspace)

The ```/doc``` folder of the ```workspace``` repo has the documentation. 

I will gradually migrate the notes I have to this repository. To keep track of what I am adding:

---

## Generic

- cellular_automata
- containers
- environment
- lambdas
- strings
...

---

## Linux/UNIX networking

- networking_cli_serv
  Simple daytime server and client
- networking_web
  Simple web server, listens on port 80 and generates a page with a timestamp.
  Start the server, look in browser to 'localhost', do do ```$ curl localhost```
