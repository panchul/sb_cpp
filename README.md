# sb_cpp

## UNDER CONSTRUCTION

C/C++ sandbox for variety of templates, tutorial snippets, etc.

This repository could be a useful starting point for writing code, or demoing how to write code.
It could be used on its own, or deployed on a virtual machine within the workspace [https://github.com/panchul/workspace](https://github.com/panchul/workspace)

The ```/doc``` folder of the ```workspace``` repo has the documentation. 

I will gradually migrate the notes I have to this repository. To keep track of what I am adding:


## Generic

** TODO **

## Linux/UNIX networking

** TODO **


## Graphics

** TODO **
